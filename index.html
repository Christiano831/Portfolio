                            <!-- I started at a young age working with my father's construction company and learned how to work in a fast paced environment. 
                            I then went to Fresno State with the intention of being a veterinarian. While studying I got a job offer to work at Fresno State Dairy. 
                            There I learned to work efficiently while remaining calm to not stress out the cattle. I proved myself to be a great asset to the team and got promoted to Herdsman. 
                            As a herdsman I was responsible for training new employees and managing the student employees. I was also responsilble for the overall herd health of over 300 cattle. 
                            Soon after I got an internship at a veterinary clinic, Clovis Pet Hospital. I learned to remain calm during emergency situations while still being able to think quick. 
                            The owner liked my work ethic and ability to work under pressure and offered me a part time postition as I was still in school. 
                            When I graduated from Fresno State, I actually went to veterinary school for a year. 
                            After a year of vet school, I decided it was too much of an investment as it is very expensive. I left veterinary school and moved back to Monterey, California. 
                            I got a job offer with Monterey Zoo and I quickly got promoted to be an Elephant Keeper which is known as the highest position available at the zoo.
                            I was able to show off all my skills and I was actually allowed to be the first lead elephant keeper without a supervisor.
                            The zoo transferred the elephants to a new facility and so I no longer had the same challenge as before. I was seeking a new challenge and so I revisited the tech industry.
                            I have always had an affinity with technology and I was recommended with programming. I decided to dive into programming and so I enrolled in a software engineering immersive program with General Assembly.
                            I have been enjoying every moment of programming and am thrilled to overcome the endless problem solving that will come with it. -->
